# Treasurenet Protocol 

Treasurenet Protocol offers a remedy for the significant shortfall of enduring and substantial value within the cryptocurrency realm. Our objective is to merge real-world economic forces with the scalability of distributed ledger technology. As a layer 1 protocol, Treasurenet Protocol aims to set a precedent for maintaining value across both the fiat and digital domains.
